* WireMock's Spring Boot integration
  * allows 
    * configure & run >=1 WireMock instances | JUnit tests
    * simple,
    * declarative 

## Installation

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.wiremock.integrations</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock-spring-boot</artifactId>
    <version>{{ site.spring_boot_integration_version }}</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
implementation 'org.wiremock.integrations:wiremock-spring-boot:{{ site.spring_boot_integration_version }}'
```

## How to use?

* ðŸ’¡add `@EnableWireMock` | your test class ðŸ’¡
  * -> properties / set, by default, | Spring context
    * `wiremock.server.baseUrl`
      * == WireMock server's base URL
    * `wiremock.server.port`
      * == WireMock server's HTTP port
* _Example:_ [here](https://github.com/dancer1325/wiremock-spring-boot/blob/main/src/test/java/usecases/ExampleTests.java)

## How to customize the configuration?
* ðŸ’¡use `@ConfigureWireMock` ðŸ’¡ 
### Declarative

* `port`
  * == HTTP port number
    * by default, it's random
* `httpsPort`
  * == HTTPS port number
    * by default, it's random
* `name`
  * == WireMock instance name
    * by default, `wiremock`
    * if you run MULTIPLE WireMock instances -> recommended to set it 
* `usePortFromPredefinedPropertyIfFound`: if true, take the port number from the Spring configuration. Defaults to false.
* `portProperties`
  * -- overrides -- HTTP port property name
* `httpsPortProperties`: Overrides for the HTTPS port property name.
* `baseUrlProperties`
  * -- overrides -- HTTP base URL property name
* `httpsBaseUrlProperties`: Overrides for the HTTPS base URL property name.
* `filesUnderClasspath`: Classpath root that will be used as the WireMock instance's file source. See [Customizing the mappings directory](#customizing-the-mappings-directory) for details.
* `filesUnderDirectory`: File root that will be used as the WireMock instance's file source. See [Customizing the mappings directory](#customizing-the-mappings-directory) for details.
* `extensions`: WireMock extensions to be loaded, specified as class names.
* `extensionFactories`: WireMock extension factories to be loaded, specified as class names.
* `configurationCustomizers`: Customizer classes to be applied to the configuration object passed to the WireMock instance on construction. See [Programmatic configuration](#programmatic-configuration) for details.

* _Example:_ [here](https://github.com/dancer1325/wiremock-spring-boot/blob/main/src/test/java/usecases/ExampleConfigurationDeclarativeTests.java)

### Programmatic
* TODO:
If full control over the WireMock server's configuration is needed you can supply a customizer class that can call methods directly on the
WireMock configuration object.

```java
@EnableWireMock({
    @ConfigureWireMock(
        configurationCustomizers = CustomizerTest.Customizer.class)
})
public class CustomizerTest {
    
    static class Customizer implements WireMockConfigurationCustomizer {

        @Override
        public void customize(
            WireMockConfiguration configuration,
            ConfigureWireMock options
        ) {
            configuration.notifier(new CustomNotifier());
        }
    }
}
```



## Customizing the mappings directory
By default, each `WireMockServer` is configured to load WireMock root from:

1. Classpath *if specified*
   1. `{specified-resource-name}/{server-name}`
   2. `{specified-resource-name}`
2. Directory
   1. `{CWD}/wiremock/{server-name}`
   2. `{CWD}/stubs/{server-name}`
   3. `{CWD}/mappings/{server-name}`
   4. `{CWD}/wiremock`
   5. `{CWD}/stubs`
   6. `{CWD}/mappings`

This can be changed as follows:

```java
@EnableWireMock({
  @ConfigureWireMock(
      name = "fs-client",
      filesUnderClasspath = "some/classpath/resource",
      filesUnderDirectory = "or/a/directory")
})
```

## Injecting WireMock instances into the test
Sometimes it's necessary to gain programmatic access to a running WireMock instance e.g. to configure stubs or perform verifications.

To enable this you can inject the WireMock server into a field on the test class as follows:

```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = InjectionTest.AppConfiguration.class)
@EnableWireMock
public class InjectionTest {

  @InjectWireMock
  WireMockServer wireMock;

}
```

As described in the next section you can also specify the name of the desired instance when injecting:

```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = InjectionTest.AppConfiguration.class)
@EnableWireMock({
  @ConfigureWireMock(name = "user-service")
})
public class InjectionTest {

  @InjectWireMock("user-service")
  WireMockServer mockUserService;

  @Test
  void fetch_empty_list_of_users() {
    
    mockUserService.stubFor(get("/users").willReturn(okJson("[]")));

    // ...
  }
}
```

## Running multiple instances
It's typically a good idea to run a WireMock instance per API you wish to mock, primarily to avoid clashes in the URL schemes of the two (or more) APIs.

The Spring Boot integration supports this explictly via annotation configuration. By adding more than one configuration item, multiple instances will be
started and the associated properties added to the Spring context.

These instances can then be injected as fields on the test class to 


```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = WireMockSpringExtensionTest.AppConfiguration.class)
@EnableWireMock({
  @ConfigureWireMock(
      name = "user-service",
      baseUrlProperties = "user-service.url",
      portProperties = "user-service.port"),
  @ConfigureWireMock(
      name = "todo-service",
      baseUrlProperties = "todo-service.url",
      portProperties = "todo-service.port")
})
public class WireMockSpringExtensionTest {

  @SpringBootApplication
  static class AppConfiguration {}

  @InjectWireMock("user-service")
  private WireMockServer mockUserService;

  @InjectWireMock("todo-service")
  private WireMockServer mockTodoService;
}
```
